## Motivation

Sometimes you need to execute small tasks or functions and integrate this execution into existing
infrastructure with your enterprise set-up of security, user management and others.
If you want to run administration tasks directly from the Camunda 7 Task list using auto-generated mini-processes.

## Solution

This lib/spring-boot-auto-config allows you to generate and deploy single-service-task processes that can be 
started from the Camunda Webapp Tasklist. Doing so enables you to implement administration / house-keeping 
jobs as a process, use Camunda's Form/UI and run tasks controlled with the full power of the engine, 
including error handling and analysis.

## Features

- The created process will include one service task (with id `activityId` and label `label`), 
- The service task will execute a fixed Java Delegate, calling the Admin Process Registry to resolve provided lambda expression
- The process will have provided `name`, `historyTtl` and an optional `tenantId`
- The process is marked as `startable from tasklist`
- If a list of form fields is supplied, the autogenerated-form will be shown in the task list
