# Example no engine

This example demonstrates how to use Camunda BPM Data in order to work with simple maps. This is useful, if your application
is not a Camunda Engine. Of course any access to methods involving the real engine won't work, but others will do..

To do so, we use a special library `camunda-bpm-api` which is a third-party artifact separating the Camunda Engine API from its 
implementation. Check the `pom.xml` for more details.
