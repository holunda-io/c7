## Motivation

Starting from 2012, we are preaching that processes are no units. Behavior-driven development (BDD) and the
underlying testing methodology of scenario-based testing is a way more adequate and convenient for writing
process (model) tests. 

Our first attempts addressed testing frameworks Cucumber and JBehave. For JBehave we were able to release
an official [Camunda BPM extension](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-jbehave), but it turned out that the main problem
in using it, was error-prone writing of the test specifications in Gherkin (text files) and glue code them with Java.

This is, where [JGiven](http://jgiven.org/) comes on the scene, allowing to write both in Java or any other JVM language
by providing a nice API and later generating reports which are human-readable.

## Usage

Add the following dependency to your Maven pom:

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>io.holunda.testing</groupId>
  <artifactId>camunda-bpm-jgiven</artifactId>
  <version>0.0.8</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```
## Features

JGiven supports separation of the glue code (application driver) into so-called [stages](http://jgiven.org/userguide/#_stages_and_state_sharing).
Stages contain assert and action methods and may be subclassed. This library provides a base class
`ProcessStage` for building your process testing stages. Here is how the test then looks like
(written in Kotlin):

```kotlin
@Test
fun `should automatically approve`() {

  val approvalRequestId = UUID.randomUUID().toString()

  GIVEN
    .process_is_deployed(ApprovalProcessBean.KEY)
    .AND
    .process_is_started_for_request(approvalRequestId)
    .AND
    .approval_strategy_can_be_applied(Expressions.ApprovalStrategy.AUTOMATIC)
    .AND
    .automatic_approval_returns(Expressions.ApprovalDecision.APPROVE)

  WHEN
    .process_continues()

  THEN
    .process_is_finished()
    .AND
    .process_has_passed(Elements.SERVICE_AUTO_APPROVE, Elements.END_APPROVED)

}
```

Here is the corresponding stage, providing the steps used in the test:

```kotlin
class ApprovalProcessActionStage : ProcessStage<ApprovalProcessActionStage, ApprovalProcessBean>() {

  @BeforeStage
  fun `automock all delegates`() {
    CamundaMockito.registerJavaDelegateMock(DETERMINE_APPROVAL_STRATEGY)
    CamundaMockito.registerJavaDelegateMock(AUTOMATICALLY_APPROVE_REQUEST)
    CamundaMockito.registerJavaDelegateMock(ApprovalProcessBean.Expressions.LOAD_APPROVAL_REQUEST)
  }

  fun process_is_started_for_request(approvalRequestId: String) = step {
    processInstanceSupplier = ApprovalProcessBean(camunda.processEngine)
    processInstanceSupplier.start(approvalRequestId)
    assertThat(processInstanceSupplier.processInstance).isNotNull
    assertThat(processInstanceSupplier.processInstance).isStarted
  }

  fun approval_strategy_can_be_applied(approvalStrategy: String) = step {
    getJavaDelegateMock(DETERMINE_APPROVAL_STRATEGY).onExecutionSetVariables(Variables.putValue(APPROVAL_STRATEGY, approvalStrategy))
  }

  fun automatic_approval_returns(approvalDecision: String) = step {
    getJavaDelegateMock(AUTOMATICALLY_APPROVE_REQUEST).onExecutionSetVariables(Variables.putValue(APPROVAL_DECISION, approvalDecision))
  }
}
```

The resulting report:

## Contribution

We use gitflow for development. If you want to contribute, start and create
an issue. Then fork the repository, create a feature branch and provide a 
pull-request against `develop`.

If you have permissions to release, make sure all branches are fetched and run: 

     ./mvnw gitflow:release-start 
     ./mvnw gitflow:release-finish
     
from cli. This will update the poms of `develop` and `master` branches 
and start GitHub actions producing a new release.
