This Camunda Platform 7 and Platform 8 community extension **visualises** test process **paths** and **checks** your process model **coverage** ratio. Running  typical JUnit tests now leaves **html** files in your build output. Just open one and check yourself what your test did:

## Highlights

* **Visually verify** the paths covered by individual tests **methods** and whole test **classes**
* Visually check gateway **expressions** and transaction borders (**save points**) used by your process
* Calculate and **verify** the nodes (_and_ sequence flow) **coverage** ratio reached by tests methods and classes.
