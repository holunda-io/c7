This Camunda BPM community extension **visualises** test process **paths** and **checks** your process model **coverage** ratio. Running  typical JUnit tests now leaves **html** files in your build output. Just open one and check yourself what your test did:

## Highlights

* **Visually verify** the paths covered by individual tests **methods** and whole test **classes**
* Visually check gateway **expressions** and transaction borders (**savepoints**) used by your process
* Calculate and **verify** the nodes (_and_ sequence flow) **coverage** ratio reached by tests methods and classes

* Integrates with all versions of Camunda BPM starting with 7.3.0 and upwards 
* Works with all relevant Java versions: 1.6, 1.7 and 1.8 - using **JUnit 4.12** (4.11 does not work)
* Is continuously checked against latest Camunda BPM releases - see the full [**travis-ci**](https://travis-ci.org/camunda/camunda-bpm-process-test-coverage) matrix for details

## Get started with *3 simple steps*

<a href="https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.camunda.bpm.extension/camunda-bpm-process-test-coverage"><img src="https://maven-badges.herokuapp.com/maven-central/org.camunda.bpm.extension/camunda-bpm-process-test-coverage/badge.svg" align="right" /></a>**1.** Add a **Maven test dependency** to your project

```xml
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.camunda.bpm.extension</groupId>
  <artifactId>camunda-bpm-process-test-coverage</artifactId>
  <version>0.3.2</version>
  <scope>test</scope>
</dependency>
```

**2.** Use the **ProcessCoverageInMemProcessEngineConfiguration**, e.g. in your `camunda.cfg.xml`

```xml
<bean id="processEngineConfiguration"
   class="org.camunda.bpm.extension.process_test_coverage.junit.rules.ProcessCoverageInMemProcessEngineConfiguration">
   ...
</bean>
```

**3.** Use the **TestCoverageProcessEngineRule** as your process engine JUnit rule

```java
@Rule
@ClassRule
public static ProcessEngineRule rule = TestCoverageProcessEngineRuleBuilder.create().build();
```

Running your JUnit tests now leaves **html** files for inidividual test methods as well as whole test classes in your project's `target/process-test-coverage` folder. Just open one, check yourself - and have fun with your process tests! :smile:

## New! Get Started with Spring Testing

See a unit test example wired for Spring Testing [here](https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-process-test-coverage/blob/master/test/src/test/java/org/camunda/bpm/extension/process_test_coverage/spring/SpringProcessWithCoverageTest.java).
