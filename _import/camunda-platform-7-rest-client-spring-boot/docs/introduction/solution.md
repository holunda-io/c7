The library uses the popular Java REST client OpenFeign embedded into Spring-Cloud-Feign-Starter
and provides implementations of [Java Camunda Platform 7 Engine Core API](https://docs.camunda.org/manual/latest/), 
accessing the remote engine via REST API.

In doing so, the remote version of the Camunda Engine API can be easily integrated in existing application using a SpringBoot Starter.

Depending on your usage scenario, you can choose from two starters shipped by the library.
