== {{ page.title }}

If you are interested in developing and building the project please follow the following instruction.

=== Version control

To get sources of the project, please execute:

[source,bash]
----
git clone https://github.com/holunda-io/camunda-bpm-data.git
cd camunda-bpm-data
----

We are using gitflow in our git SCM. That means that you should start from `develop` branch,
create a `feature/<name>` out of it and once it is completed create a pull request containing
it. Please squash your commits before submitting and use semantic commit messages, if possible.

=== Project Build

Perform the following steps to get a development setup up and running.

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw clean install
----

=== Integration Tests

By default, the build command will ignore the run of `failsafe` Maven plugin executing the integration tests
(usual JUnit tests with class names ending with ITest). In order to run integration tests, please
call from your command line:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw integration-test failsafe:verify
----

=== Project build modes and profiles

==== Camunda Version

You can choose the used Camunda version by specifying the profile `camunda-ee` or `camunda-ce`. The default
version is a Community Edition. Specify `-Pcamunda-ee` to switch to Camunda Enterprise edition. This will
require a valid Camunda license. You can put it into a file `~/.camunda/license.txt` and it will be detected
automatically.

==== Documentation

We are using Orchid for generation of a static site documentation and rely on AsciiDoc as much as possible.

TIP: If you want to develop your docs in 'live' mode, run `./mvnw -f docs -Pdocs-serve` and access
the http://localhost:8080/ from your browser.

For creation of documentation, please run:

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw -f docs orchid:build
----

WARNING: This operation requires special permissions. You need to replace `GITHUB_TOKEN` by the token of
the github pages repository, allowing to publish the pages.

In order to publish documentation to github pages, please run from command line

[source,bash]
----
./mvnw -f docs -Pdeploy-docs -DgithubToken=GITHUB_TOKEN
----

==== Starting example application

To start applications, either use your IDE and create
run configuration for the class:

* `org.camunda.bpm.extension.feign.example.CamundaBpmFeignExampleApplication`

Alternatively, you can run them from the command line:

[source,bash]
----
./mvn spring-boot:run -f example
----

=== Continuous Integration

Travis CI is building all branches on commit hook. In addition, a private-hosted Jenkins CI
is used to build the releases.

=== Release Management

Release management has been set-up for use of Sonatype Nexus (= Maven Central)

==== What modules get deployed to repository

Every module is enabled by default. If you want to change this, please provide the property

[source,xml]
----
<maven.deploy.skip>true</maven.deploy.skip>
----

inside the corresponding `pom.xml`. Currently, all examples are _EXCLUDED_ from publication into Maven Central.

==== Trigger new release

WARNING: This operation requires special permissions.

We use gitflow for development (see http://nvie.com/posts/a-successful-git-branching-model/[A successful git branching model]
for more details). You could use gitflow with native git commands, but then you would have
to change the versions in the poms manually. Therefore we use the
https://github.com/aleksandr-m/gitflow-maven-plugin/[mvn gitflow plugin], which handles this and other
things nicely.

You can build a release with:

[source,sh]
----
./mvnw gitflow:release-start
./mvnw gitflow:release-finish
----

This will update the versions in the `pom.xml` s accordingly and push the release tag to the `master` branch
and update the `develop` branch for the new development version.

==== Trigger a deploy

WARNING: This operation requires special permissions.

Currently, CI allows for deployment of artifacts to Maven Central and is executed on Holisticon Jenkins.
This means, that a push to `master` branch will start the corresponding build job, and if successful the
artifacts will get into `Staging Repositories` of OSS Sonatype without manual intervention.

If you still want to execute the the deployment from your local machine, you need to execute the
following command on the `master` branch:

[source,sh]
----
./mvnw clean deploy -B -DskipTests -Prelease
----

==== Release to public repositories

WARNING: This operation requires special permissions.

The deploy job will publish the artifacts to Nexus OSS staging repositories. Don't forget to close and release the
repository to enable it's sync with Maven Central.
