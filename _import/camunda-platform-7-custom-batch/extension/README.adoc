## What is camunda batch

Currently camunda batch is mainly used for offloading the workload during internally commands like e.g. process migration or process cancellation.

So if you e.g. choose 10000 processes for process migration, the engine will create an batch which will handle those instances in small chunks.
By default, the batch will join 100 jobs, where each job will work on one process migration. (In it's own transaction!)
After this, it will create another 100 jobs, until the work on all instances is finished.
Benefit of this is that the migration will not block anything, and there is also not just one big transaction.

Additionally, the cockpit already provides a view to monitor batches. (_https://docs.camunda.org/manual/7.6/webapps/cockpit/batch/monitoring/[See also]_)

## Why this extension

Up to now there is just a predefined set of commands, and it's very time consuming and complex to define an own batch.
With this extension it will be much more easier to do create an own batch.
This could be helpful to e.g. offload hugh workload like doing reassignment of user tasks.

## How to use

### Provide implementation of CustomBatchJobHandler

Job Handler will be called by job executor to work on small chunks of batch data.

You just have to provide two methods there:

* execute(List<T> data, CommandContext commandContext)

This method will be called by the batch job.
It depends on the configuration of the batch (invocationsPerBatchJob) how much data you will get here.

* getType()

The name / id of the job handler.

.Example Implementation:
```
@Component
public class MyCustomBatchJobHandler extends CustomBatchJobHandler<String> {
  @Override
  public void execute(List<String> data, CommandContext commandContext) {
      logger.info("Work on data: {}", data.get(0));
  }

  @Override
  public String getType() {
      return "simple-batch-handler";
  }
}
```

The abstract CustomBatchJobHandler takes care about:

* Creating Jobs + saving Configuration to ByteArray Table

* Reading data from ByteArray Table for each Batch Jobs

* Cleanup of Jobs + Configuration

### Register job handler

You have to register the implementation of the job handler during startup of engine.
This can be done by passing the job handler to the CustomBatchHandlerPlugin and adding this plugin to the engine.

.With spring boot it would be enough to provide this as a bean:
```
@Bean
public ProcessEnginePlugin customBatchHandlerPlugin(MyCustomBatchJobHandler myCustomBatchJobHandler) {
  return new CustomBatchHandlerPlugin(Collections.singletonList(myCustomBatchJobHandler));
}
```

.If you just use camunda.cfg.xml / applicationContext.xml to configure your engine:
```
    <property name="processEnginePlugins">
      <list>

        <bean class="org.camunda.bpm.extension.batch.plugin.CustomBatchHandlerPlugin">
          <constructor-arg>
            <bean class="org.camunda.bpm.extension.batch.example.simple.SimpleCustomBatchJobHandler"/>
          </constructor-arg>
        </bean>

      </list>
    </property>
```

* _https://github.com/camunda/camunda-bpm-custom-batch/blob/master/extension/core/src/test/resources/camunda.cfg.xml[camunda.cfg.xml]_

### Create the batch

For creating the batch, you have to use the CustomBatchBuilder.

In the minimum setting (with default batch values and configuration from Context) this looks like:

```
 final Batch batch = CustomBatchBuilder.of(data) #List of Objects which should be processed
        .jobHandler(simpleCustomBatchJobHandler)
        .create();
```

When calling create, the batch will be inserted and the job executor will start to work on the batch with it's next run.

The builder takes care about:

* Creating the Batch (Entity)

* Creating the Seed and Monitor Job

* Saves the BatchConfiguration data, no matter of the data type

* Saves you from handling with ConfigurationBytes

### Configuration of the batch

The batch could be configured during building it with CustomBatchBuilder:

```
 final Batch batch = CustomBatchBuilder.of(data)
        .configuration(configuration)
        .jobHandler(simpleCustomBatchJobHandler)
        .jobsPerSeed(10)
        .invocationsPerBatchJob(5)
        .create(configuration.getCommandExecutorTxRequired());
```

#### configuration

Per default, the builder tries to get the process engine configuration from context.

```
Context.getProcessEngineConfiguration()
```

Custom Configuration could be set with:

```
CustomBatchBuilder.of().configuration(configuration)
```


#### jobHandler

Here you have to provide the batch job handler which should be used by the batch.

```
CustomBatchBuilder.of().jobHandler(simpleCustomBatchJobHandler)
```

#### jobsPerSeed

Number of batch execution jobs created per seed job invocation.
The batch seed job is invoked until it has created all batch execution jobs required by the batch.

```
CustomBatchBuilder.of().jobsPerSeed(10)
```

Default is 100


#### invocationsPerBatchJob

How many data should be passed to the job handler.

E.g., for the process instance migration batch this specifies the number of process instances which are migrated per batch execution job.

```
CustomBatchBuilder.of().invocationsPerBatchJob(5)
```
Default is 1
