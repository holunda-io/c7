# Simple example with spring boot and camunda cockpit

Simple example which uses an embedded engine.
On startup a batch will be created which works on a list of random string data.

Start with mvn spring-boot:run.

Cockpit is running on http://localhost:10100/app/cockpit/default/

To use Batch functions, camunda ee is required.
To enable ee, put your licence key into "resources/camunda-license.txt".
