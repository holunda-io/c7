# camunda-bpm-custom-batch

The goal of this camunda extension is to provide an simple way of using the camunda batch functionality.
Camunda Batch could be used to split a huge workload into small asynchronous jobs.
But up to now there is no simple way to use this, because itâ€™s just used for camunda internal batch operations.
With this extension, we want to open the camunda batch functionality to everyone.

## Get started

The extension will be published on maven central, so if you are using maven, just add the dependency:

```
<dependency>
  <groupId>org.camunda.bpm.extension.batch.project</groupId>
  <artifactId>camunda-bpm-custom-batch-core</artifactId>
  <version>0.1-SNAPSHOT</version>
</dependency>
```

First you have to define an own job handler for working on the single batch data:

```
@Component
public class SimpleCustomBatchJobHandler extends CustomBatchJobHandler<String> {
  @Override
  public void execute(List<String> data, CommandContext commandContext) {
      logger.info("Work on data: {}", data.get(0));
  }

  @Override
  public String getType() {
      return "simple-batch-handler";
  }
}
```

Next you have to notify the engine about this job handler, e.g. with spring-boot:

```
@Bean
public ProcessEnginePlugin customBatchHandlerPlugin(SimpleCustomBatchJobHandler simpleCustomBatchJobHandler) {
  return new CustomBatchHandlerPlugin(Collections.singletonList(simpleCustomBatchJobHandler));
}
```

Finally, the creation of the batch itself:

```
CustomBatchBuilder.of(listOfStringData)
 .jobHandler(simpleCustomBatchJobHandler)
 .create();
 ```
